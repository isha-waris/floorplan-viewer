2D Floorplan Viewer - README

Overview

Project Overview

This 2D Floorplan Viewer project has been developed using React for enhanced interactivity and maintainability. Although initially requested to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I opted for React to leverage its modern architecture, which supports better scalability and future enhancements. The application visualizes a small home with four walls (regions), a single door, and essential furniture including one sofa, one chair, and one table.

 **Why React and How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are Used
Although the project was originally requested to be implemented using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I chose to use React for its component-based architecture, efficient state management with Context API and reducers, and its future-proof nature. React allows for modular development, making the codebase easier to manage and scale. In this project, HTML is used through JSX, enabling the inclusion of HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript. CSS is applied through traditional stylesheets or inline styles within components, and JavaScript is used for logic and behavior, including managing state and side effects with React hooks. This approach ensures the application is modern, maintainable, and scalable.
